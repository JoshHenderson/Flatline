 HTTP Request Methods.

 - HEAD: Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body.
 - POST: Create.
 - PUT: Uploads a representation of the specified URI.
 - PATCH: Update/Modify.
 - DELETE: Deletes the specified resource.
 - TRACE: Echo's back input back to the user.
 - CONNECT: Urges your proxy to establish an HTTP tunnel to the remote end-point.
